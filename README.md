# Angular Projects

This repository contains multiple Angular projects I developed while following a Udemy course on Angular. Each folder represents a different hands-on project that helped me understand key concepts of Angular, such as components, directives, routing, services, pipes, and more.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `create-unique-password`: A simple Angular app that generates secure passwords with customizable options. Demonstrates form handling and basic component logic.

- `letter-project`: This application lets the user retype a given sentence. It checks if the input matches the provided sentence exactly and displays a ‚ÄúBravo!‚Äù message if it does. It's a great example of two-way data binding and event handling in Angular.

- `middle-earth-cards`: A fun Angular app that displays character cards from the Middle-earth universe. It includes routing between character pages and showcases how to use services and components together.

- `pipes`: This project demonstrates how to use Angular pipes. It includes examples of built-in pipes like `uppercase`, `date`, and `currency`, as well as custom pipes. Ideal for learning how to format data dynamically in templates.

- `simple-angular-pages`: A project focused on conditional rendering and pagination using Angular directives like `ngFor`, `ngIf`, and `ngSwitch`.
